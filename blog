				PKCS#12 Issues Between IBM and Oracle JREs
			</h5>
			<p>
				We had an issue recently with our PKCS#12 keystore that had us stumped for days. When trying to access a SOAP web service
				over HTTPS (mutual authentication) from a stand-alone application we started getting "Unexpected error: java.security.
				InvalidAlgorithmParameterException: the trustAnchors parameter must be non-empty". I normally use KeyStore Explorer (KSE)
				tool when working with stores and certificates. In this case KSE was able to both open the keystore and list the private
				key and certificates stored within (note: as this store was used for testing it was used as a truststore as well as the
				keystore).

				Configuring Spring Security for Authentication Using Microsoft’s Active Directory
			</h5>
			<p>
				I was recently working on a project that required us to integrate our Spring MVC application with Microsoft’s Active
				Directory (AD). Most online tutorials discuss using a privileged system account for perfoming lookups of the user’s
				distinguished name (DN) based on the provided at login user name. Setting up a generic system account to enable
				authentication from our application became problametic due to organisational policies.

				Single Sign-on for WebSphere Applications Using Oracle OAM and SAML
			</h5>
			<p>
				Recently, I was asked to assist with an integration of an existing suite of JEE web applications with an Oracle single 
				sign-on solution being rolled out across a large organisation. The IBM WebSphere platform that was used for running
				existing web applications was somewhat outdated (WAS v6.1) and there was no possibility of an upgrade. To make things even
				more difficult, the applications in question used a home grown single sign-on solution with little documentation. The
				project brief was simple. Develop a proof of concept solution to demonstrate to management that their current assets can be
				migrated to the new single sign-on platform without major (or preferably any) changes to the above mentioned applications.

				Spring Remoting for Web and Business Tier Separation
			</h5>
			<p>
				I remember when I first started using EJBs, there was a lot of talk about physical separation of the presentation and
				business tiers via remote interfaces and RMI. So, technically you could have your business logic sitting on a different
				server than you web application. It sounds great but I cannot remember actually doing that. My web and business tiers have
				always been packaged into a single EAR and deployed as a one, monolithic application. When I moved away from EJBs and 
				started using the Struts/Spring/Hibernate combination I didn’t give much thought about this until recently when on my 
				latest project someone (thanks Shine) reminded me how you can achieve the same separation of tiers using Spring remoting.
				After all, this is still a great enterprise design pattern and I’m surprised I haven’t encountered it more often. Allow me
				to share it.

				Tomcat, Atlassian Crowd and JAAS
			</h5>
			<p>
				I have recently rolled out a single sign-on solution using Atlassian Crowd. My client’s applications were running on Apache
				Tomcat and required FORM based authentication. After briefly Googling around, I have found the Crowd JAAS Login Module which
				fitted my requirements perflectly. Here is an example of how to integrate a Crowd JAAS login module into Tomcat so that all
				web applications can be authenticated against the Crowd server. The following instructions were tested against Crowd 2.0
				and Tomcat 6.0.29. You will need at least Tomcat 6.0.20 to make some of the instructions that follow work.

				Tomcat Single Sign-on With Common Login Page
			</h5>
			<p>
				Recently, while rolling out a single sign-on solution for a client, I have stumbled across an interesting problem. Here’s
				the situation. We had a bunch of web applications that needed to be deployed onto Apache Tomcat (v6.0.29) server. Each
				application needed to be secured using FORM based authentication. We were using Atlassian Crowd identity management
				application for managing our users and providing the authentication and authorisation services. The integration of the
				Tomcat server with Crowd was straight forward. Using Tomcat’s JAASRealm implementation and Crowd’s third party
				CrowdLoginModule JAAS module, we managed to successfully get our users authenticated using BASIC authentication method.
